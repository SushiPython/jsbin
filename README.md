## Simple Anonymous Pastebin- v2

Rewrite of previous text uploader, [PyBin](https://github.com/SushiPython/PyBin).

I wrote this because Hastebin seems to be not working, and also it seems fun.

If you want to host it yourself, all you need is a MongoDB Atlas cluster, and you can simply replace the value in your env or manually hard code it in the main js file.
